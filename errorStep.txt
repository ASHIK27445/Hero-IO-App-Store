ðŸŸ¦ Option 1: Use copy Command (Windows CMD)
copy dist\index.html dist\200.html
copy dist\index.html dist\404.html


âœ… Works directly in Command Prompt.

Note: Use backslashes (\) in file paths.

ðŸŸ¨ Option 2: Use PowerShell

If youâ€™re using PowerShell, use Copy-Item:

Copy-Item dist\index.html dist\200.html
Copy-Item dist\index.html dist\404.html

ðŸŸ© Option 3: Use Git Bash or WSL

If you have Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed, you can use the original cp commands as-is:

cp dist/index.html dist/200.html
cp dist/index.html dist/404.html


âœ… Ideal if you're following a tutorial meant for Linux/Mac.

Would you like me to explain why these commands are usually needed in frontend projects (e.g., React/Vite apps deployed to Netlify)?
